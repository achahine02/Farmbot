# Farmbot
Farmbot project as part of my internship at FH Joanneum

This project documents the design and integration of a 24 V water pump system into the FarmBot Genesis v1.6
 platform, carried out in collaboration with FH Joanneum.

The goal was to reliably control a diaphragm water pump using the Farmduinoâ€™s peripheral outputs while protecting the board from overcurrent and inductive loads. To achieve this, we developed a dedicated relay + power supply system housed in a custom-designed enclosure.

ðŸ”§ System Overview

The Farmduino peripheral pin is used only as a low-current signal to switch a 24 V relay module.

The relay module controls the connection between a separate 24 V power supply and the water pump.

A custom enclosure was designed and fabricated to house the relay module and PSU, ensuring safe wiring and maintainability.

This approach keeps the pump current (2.5â€“6 A) fully isolated from the Farmduino, while still allowing control via the FarmBot web interface.

ðŸ›  Hardware Used

FarmBot Genesis 1.6 (Farmduino board + Raspberry Pi 4)

24 V diaphragm pump (nominal 2.5 A)

24 V relay module (4-channel, optocoupler-based)

24 V power supply for pump (independent from Farmduino PSU)

Custom relay + PSU enclosure 

ðŸš€ Outcomes

Safe, reliable pump control integrated into the FarmBot platform.

Modular design: the pump system can be swapped or upgraded without modifying the Farmduino board.

Documentation and open-source sharing to support other FarmBot users with similar needs.
